# Habit Tracker
This is a console habit tracker app.
You can add new habits.
When you add same habit you get +1 streak.
You can check your streak of your each strak or all of them.

# How it works?
When you add a new habit it adds it to the dictionary with its key being habit and value being streak.
When you add an existing habit again it adds +1 to the value.
When you want to check your streak based on your habit it returns your habit + streak same for the second show streak option.
It adds all the habits and streaks to a json file and reads them at the start of app.
